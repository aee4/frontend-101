        FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python, designed for speed, simplicity, and efficiency.<br> It leverages Python type hints to provide automatic data validation, serialization, and interactive API documentation via Swagger UI and ReDoc.<br> Built on Starlette and Pydantic, FastAPI is asynchronous by default, making it ideal for handling high-concurrency applications.<br> It supports dependency injection, OAuth2 authentication, background tasks, and WebSockets, making it suitable for both small projects and enterprise applications.<br> Its automatic generation of OpenAPI and JSON Schema ensures seamless integration with frontends, mobile apps, and microservices, providing a developer-friendly experience with minimal boilerplate.
